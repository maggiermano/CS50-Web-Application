  <p>Arjen Robben is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a winger and captains Eredivisie club Groningen. 
     He is known for his dribbling skills, speed, ball control, and his long-range shots. Usually deployed on the right wing, 
     Robben's signature move is cutting in on his left foot to move to a more central attacking position, and uses his speed and dribbling 
     skills to take on defenders until he finds the space to make an attempt on goal. He is able to take on and beat defenders at the drop of a hat, 
     Robben's ability to get to the byline and deliver in accurate crosses instils fear into any defence. Defenders better watch out for you!
