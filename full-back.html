  <p>Trent John Alexander-Arnold is an English professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Premier League club Liverpool and the England national team.
     Trent has emerged as one of the Premier League's most creative players due to his role in assisting goals from early crosses and set-piece deliveries.
     He possesses an impressive passing range, and is a set-piece specialist for deadball situations. 
     His overlapping runs, switching of play, accuracy of crossing and work-rate in tracking back makes him a two-in one type player. A manager would kill for such a player, 
     so expect to get a lot of knocks on your door in the future.
