  <p>Andrés Iniesta Luján is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder and is known for his career at Barcelona, where he served as the captain for three seasons.
     Iniesta is widely considered to be one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest midfielders of all time.
     He is quiet by nature but always has such an impact on the game and thus he helped to redefine the role of a midfielder. 
     Being smaller in stature was never an issue, and Iniesta always played to his strengths. Technically, there has never been a better player with the ball. 
     His incredible dribbling and eye for a pass made him one of the world’s best, so defenders are gonna have quite the headache when they match up against you!.</p>
