### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I'll make a website that contains some webpages including one that allows users to buy and sell football apparel and that allows user to login and register as members

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I'll make a website that contains some webpages including one that allows users to buy and sell football apparel and that allows user to login and register as members.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I'll make a website that contains some webpages including one that allows users to buy and sell football apparel and that allows user to login and register as members.
The website will have functioning webpages other than the buying and selling one. Users of this part of the wbsite can then see if certain products on the market have been bought.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would have to figure out how to implement the selling. 
How users can input their apparel and when its been sold the website will say sold.
I'd have to research python/flask more in depth.
