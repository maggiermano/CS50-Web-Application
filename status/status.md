Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have set up the web application part of the project. There is a functional sell, buy and view items page. User can view items they have put on the market as well as delete them once they have sold them.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't done the styling of the web application as well as some other additional features. I'm still working on the contact aspect as well where a user if interested in a product can get in touch with the seller.  

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Linking tables with http parameters
