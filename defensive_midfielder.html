  <p>Carlos Henrique Casimiro is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Spanish club Real Madrid and the Brazil national team. 
     Casemiro is an intelligent, physically strong, mobile, aggressive, and hard-tackling player, with an extremely high work-rate. He also contributes offensively, or even score goals, in addition to breaking up plays.
     His quick reactions, as well as his excellent positional sense, ability to read the game, and good anticipation, enable him to excel in a holding midfield role in front of the defence, by cutting out counter-attacks and shielding the back-line.
     Nicknamed "The Tank", you're a manager's dream.
